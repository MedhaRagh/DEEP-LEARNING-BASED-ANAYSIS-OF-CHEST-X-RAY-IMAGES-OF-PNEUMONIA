# DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-ANAYSIS-OF-CHEST-X-RAY-IMAGES-OF-PNEUMONIA


Pneumonia is a respiratory infection characterized by inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs, commonly caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Accurate and timely diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for effective patient management and improved outcomes. Chest X-ray images are a primary diagnostic tool for detecting pneumonia, and the integration of deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, has shown remarkable promise in automating this process.

In this report, we delve into the application of CNNs for pneumonia classification. We will explore the core concepts of CNNs, datasets used for training and evaluation, preprocessing steps to enhance model performance, various CNN architectures, evaluation metrics, challenges faced in this domain, and future directions.
